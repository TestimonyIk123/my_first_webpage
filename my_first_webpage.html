  <h1>My first webpage</h1>
  <h2>Written with the guidance of Acedu</h2>

  <P>This is my first webpage!</P>
  <p>Isn't it nice?</p>
  <P> This is a lot of text which means it spans multiple lines. When text spans multiple lines like this, it's much easier to read our code if we indent the multiple lines of text within our paragraph tags. In other words, we add a p tag,have a line break and indent, and then add our text.</P>
  <p>Here are some things I'm going to learn about coding:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>And a lot more!</li>
    
  </ul>
